Detailed Project Description (no more than 3-4 sentences)
Buy, trade or win the ingredients for brewing beer (yeast, barley, hops, and the brewery) in this gnutterly unique implementation of ERC721 tokens that lets you redeem your collectibles for real beer from real breweries. This ain't no cat-lady game - this is for real Gnus who want their hard earned scrilla to pay them back in suds while they take their mates' cards off them in head-to-head game-theory battles. Yes - you read that right, it's Rock Paper Scissors, Beer, and African wildebeests on the blockchain. The first brewery is the Low Down, just 2 blocks from the Sports Castle. Don't be a cat lady - be a Gnu brewmaster!
